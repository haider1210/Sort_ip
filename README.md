The code snippet `free_ip.sort(key=lambda ip: tuple(map(int, ip.split('.'))))` is a line of Python code that sorts a list of IP addresses in ascending order. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **List of IP Addresses**:
   - `free_ip` is assumed to be a list containing IP addresses as strings. For example:
     ```python
     free_ip = ["192.168.1.1", "10.0.0.1", "172.16.0.1"]
     ```

2. **Sorting Method**:
   - The `.sort()` method sorts the list in place. It means the original list `free_ip` will be modified to be in sorted order.

3. **Key Parameter**:
   - The `key` parameter in the `.sort()` method specifies a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons. The elements will be compared based on the value returned by this function.

4. **Lambda Function**:
   - `lambda ip: tuple(map(int, ip.split('.')))` is an anonymous function (a lambda function) that transforms each IP address into a tuple of integers.
     - `ip.split('.')` splits the IP address string by the `.` character, resulting in a list of strings. For example, "192.168.1.1" becomes `['192', '168', '1', '1']`.
     - `map(int, ip.split('.'))` converts each string in the list to an integer, resulting in a map object containing integers. For example, `['192', '168', '1', '1']` becomes `[192, 168, 1, 1]`.
     - `tuple(map(int, ip.split('.')))` converts the map object to a tuple of integers. For example, `[192, 168, 1, 1]` becomes `(192, 168, 1, 1)`.

5. **Comparison**:
   - Tuples are compared lexicographically in Python. This means that they are compared element by element, starting with the first element. If the first elements are equal, the second elements are compared, and so on. This is suitable for IP addresses, as they are naturally hierarchical in this way.

### How It Works

Consider the list `free_ip = ["192.168.1.1", "10.0.0.1", "172.16.0.1"]`.

1. The lambda function will transform each IP address:
   - "192.168.1.1" becomes `(192, 168, 1, 1)`
   - "10.0.0.1" becomes `(10, 0, 0, 1)`
   - "172.16.0.1" becomes `(172, 16, 0, 1)`

2. The `.sort()` method uses these tuples to sort the list:
   - `(10, 0, 0, 1)` < `(172, 16, 0, 1)` < `(192, 168, 1, 1)`

3. The original list `free_ip` is modified to be:
   ```python
   free_ip = ["10.0.0.1", "172.16.0.1", "192.168.1.1"]
   ```

### Why This Works for IP Addresses

IP addresses are hierarchical and can be represented as four integers separated by dots. Sorting them as tuples of integers ensures that the sorting respects the hierarchical structure of IP addresses:
- The most significant part (the first number) is compared first.
- If the most significant parts are equal, the next significant part (the second number) is compared, and so on.

This method ensures that the IP addresses are sorted in a manner that respects their numerical and hierarchical structure.

### Full Code Example

Here's the full context in which this line of code might be used:

```python
# List of IP addresses
free_ip = ["192.168.1.1", "10.0.0.1", "172.16.0.1"]

# Sort the IP addresses
free_ip.sort(key=lambda ip: tuple(map(int, ip.split('.'))))

# Print the sorted list
print(free_ip)
```

Output:
```
['10.0.0.1', '172.16.0.1', '192.168.1.1']
```

In this example, the list `free_ip` is sorted in ascending order of the IP addresses, correctly handling the numerical and hierarchical nature of IP addresses.
